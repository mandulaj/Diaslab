This project aims at creating a modular, web enabled weather station that would continuously measure data using a number of sensors, save them to a database and display the processed results using a web interface. This interface would be accessable form the internet from anywhere. The weather station would also periodically upload the data to a crowd sourced weather project in order to help weather predictions.

### Features to be implemented
* **Temperature** `DHT22`✔ - inside, outside
* Humidity `DHT22` ✔ - inside, outside
* Luminosity `SI1145, TSL2561` ✔ UV/IR/Visible
  * Spectrum analyzer??
* Pressure `BMP180` ✔
* Gas - inside, outside
  * CO `MQ-7`✔
  * CO2
  * Air quality `MQ-135`✔
  * Pollution `MQ-3`
* Wind - ultrasonic???
  * Speed
  * Direction
* Precipitation - tiping cone
  * Water pH sensor
  * Other chemical analysis??
* Rain drops  ✔
* Soil moisture ✔
* Optical Dust sensor
* Geiger counter???
* Noise sensor (calibrated microphone) 

### To get
* Anemometer - ultrasonic/mechanical
* Gas sensors
* Precipitation
* Optical dust sensor
* Geiger counter
* Interior Temperature + Humidity sensor
